a tetris clone
This is a tetris clone I wrote in C++ many years ago when I just started my way in programming.
I haven't looked it over in a very long time. I am sure that if I looked it over now I would realize that a lot of things were done wrong. Therefore you may not use this code to guage my skills as a programmer!
With all that said I think that some of the game functionality was implemented in a unique way and I hope that this code will come to be for good use to some people.
I have provided all the source code plus the binaries for mac os and windows.
If you wish to compile the source code yourself you will need to link it with SDL2 (not provided, but free and open source)
You may use this code in whichever way you wish.
